# tesseroid-spectral-solution-variable-density

Spherical harmonic expansions for the gravitational field of a tesseroid with radially variable density.

## Repository structure

- **`mcodes/`**  
  MATLAB scripts and functions.

- **`data/`**  
  Input datasets required to run the MATLAB codes.

## Key files

- **`SH_Marine_Sediment_2160.gfc`**  
  Spherical-harmonic potential coefficients of global marine sediments with 3D variable density.

- **`Gfield-tesseroid.nb`**  
  Mathematica notebook used to compute a reference gravitational field generated by a homogeneous tesseroid.

## Notes

- Ensure the `data/` directory is available and correctly referenced in the MATLAB scripts before running.
